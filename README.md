# Open Encyclopedia System Plugin - Map Module

Welcome to the Open Encyclopedia System Map (OES Map) repository on GitHub. OES is a modular and configurable software for creating, publishing and maintaining online encyclopedias in the humanities and social sciences that are accessible worldwide via Open Access. For more information please visit the main repository or our website.

A typical OES application consists of an OES plugin and an additional OES project plugin which implements the OES features for the application. The OES Map plugin is an additional OES module to represent data on an open street map.

## Documentation (Coming Soon)

We are working on a detailed user manual and a technical function reference. Support is currently provided via our email help desk info@open-encyclopedia-system.org. We answer questions related to the OES plugin and its usage.


## Getting Started

OES Map depends on the OES Core Plugin:
* OES Core, version 2.3.3, URL: https://github.com/open-encyclopedia-system/oes-core.
